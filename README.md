## Credits
- **Ali Harb** - Created school assignment that introduced me to I2C communication.

## Materials

To build a similar setup to experiment with the code:
| Item | Amount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Arduino UNO | At least 2 |
| Breadboard | 1 |

## Installation
1. If you want to download the entire repository, click on the green box and download the zip file. If you don't, skip to step 3.
2. Unzip the zip file.
3. Locate the `I2C_Assignment_1` or `I2C_Assignment_2` folder within the repository. 
4. Locate the `AssignmentX_I2C_Master.ino` and each respective `AssignmentX_I2C_Slave_X.ino` file.
5. Either copy and paste the contents of the file into your own program, or open the downloaded `.ino` files in your preffered IDE.
6. If using **[PlatformIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmvMvIphMnY)**, you may again copy and paste the contents into a seperate project, or open this folder directly.
